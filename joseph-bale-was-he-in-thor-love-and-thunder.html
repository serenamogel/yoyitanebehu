In fact, including the actors’ children was inspired by Chris Hemsworth’s desire to work alongside his daughter.</p><p>News that Joseph was one of the “Asgardian kids” in “Thor: Love and Thunder” has gotten quite many people curious about him. Fortunately, we’ve scoured the net for information, so you won’t have to. Keep reading to learn more about Joseph and his part in the hit movie.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/josb.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Was_Joseph_Bale_Born></span>When Was Joseph Bale Born?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joseph Bale entered this world on August 19, 2014, via Santa Monica, California, United States. His parents are Christian Charles Philip Bale, famously known as Christian Bale, and Sibi Blazic.&nbsp;His mother, Sibi Blazic, is a former model and makeup artist, and his father, Christian Bale, is an actor popular for his versatility and ability to adapt to fit his roles physically.</p><p>He has become a household name in the movie industry and has been well rewarded for his efforts. In 2014, Christian was even ranked as one of the highest-paid actors by Forbes magazine.</p><p>Aside from Joseph, Christian and Blazic have another child, a daughter named Emmeline Bale. She was born on March 27, 2005, in Santa Monica, California, USA. Joseph’s maternal grandparents are Slobodan Blazic and Nadezda Topalski, while his paternal grandparents are David Bale and Jenny James.</p><p>Talent has always run in their family. Unsurprisingly, Joseph Bale’s grandmother, Jenny James, was a circus performer, while his grandfather, David Bale, was an entrepreneur and activist.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Joseph_Bale_in_%E2%80%9CThor_Love_and_Thunder%E2%80%9D></span>Was Joseph Bale in “Thor: Love and Thunder?”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Joseph Bale was in “Thor: Love And Thunder.” He played a small role in the movie which Taika Waititi directed. It also featured stars like Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Christian Bale, and Tessa Thompson.&nbsp;</p><p>In the movie, Thor’s former girlfriend Jane gets to wield Mjolnir, gaining the power of Thor in an attempt to fight the cancer in her body. She teams up with Thor, Valkyrie, and Korg (Waititi) to stop Gorr from murdering all the gods.</p><p>Family is one of the film’s core themes, and as such, the children of Hemsworth, Waititi, Portman, and Christian got the chance to appear in it alongside their parents. Joseph Bale’s character did not have an official name, but he was credited as a small Asgardian kid in the movie.&nbsp;</p><p>Though nameless, the kids played a central part in the plot as they were kidnapped by Gorr, forcing Thor and his friends to save them. When the heroes locate the children, Thor gives them some of his powers so they can protect themselves from monsters in the Shadow Realm.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/balell-fotor-20231017123348.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Joseph_Bales_Sister_Was_Also_in_%E2%80%9CThor_Love_and_Thunder%E2%80%9D></span>Joseph Bale’s Sister Was Also in “Thor: Love and Thunder”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christian Bale’s daughter, Emmeline Bale, was also featured in the movie. She portrayed an Infinity Conez Vendor, a child customer at an Infinity Stone-themed ice cream shop in New Asgard.</p><p>It was a fun twist, but Waititi has revealed it was not the plan from the beginning. In an interview with Marvel, he <a href=#>explained</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>“The idea started really when Chris was talking about [his daughter] India. And he was like, ‘Oh, you know, it would kind of be quite cool for me to be in a scene with my daughter.’ I started looking around like, oh, everyone has kids. All of these actors have kids.”&nbsp;</p>Taika Waititi.<p>Chris Hemsworth also spoke about it in a July 2022 interview. He said: “Taika had his children in there. Christian Bale had his. Natalie [Portman] had her kids [in the movie] as well. It felt sort of like a one-off, fun family experience.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Joseph_Bale_Now></span>Joseph Bale Now<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is still living under his parents, who prefer to keep his exposure to the spotlight minimal. Joseph’s father, Christian Bale, is notorious for his affinity for privacy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chrisbale-fotor-20231017123412.jpg><p>The prolific actor once explained why he is so fanatical about privacy in 2014. He said, “I feel I should have as much privacy as anyone else. I prefer not to whine about it.”</p><p>Christian feels the same way about exposing his kids to publicity and has kept both Joseph and his sister away from the limelight for most of their lives. When Joseph Bale was to be born, he made no fuss on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>And even in the days that followed Joseph’s birth, <a href=#>Christian Bale </a>disclosed nothing about him. His children’s appearance in “Thor: Love and Thunder” is one of the few times they have deliberately been put in front of a camera, which makes it all the more special as we may not see it happen again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kt7C%2FxKmfZpqRobJuw8CsZKGdXZ67bsDHqKlmpJ%2Brsm6tzZ1kraClo7Gmvo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./louis-thomas-hardy-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Louis Thomas Hardy Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
