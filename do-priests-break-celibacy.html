But for the best part of a millennium, celibacy has been required of priests in the Roman Catholic tradition.<h2>Why do Catholic priests remain celibate?</h2>Advocates see clerical celibacy as "a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour."<h2>Can priests lose their virginity?</h2>Saint Augustine, prior to being a priest and then bishop, was apparently sexually active. (Confessions book 3, chapter 1): bit.ly/bc-celibacy3. So no, virginity is apparently not a requirement, but a vow of celibacy is.<h2>Can you practice celibacy if you're not a virgin?</h2>Most religions advise both the males and females to remain celibate until they take marital vows. Thus, celibacy is not the same as virginity. It is voluntary, and it can be practiced by those who have had intercourse before. Celibates can always go back to being sexually active.<h2>Priests Discuss Celibacy</h2><p></p><h2>Can a priest have a girlfriend?</h2>Almost uniquely among human occupations, priests cannot marry, as a function of their vocation; nor can they engage in sexual acts, as proscribed by Catholic moral teaching.<h2>Why is celibacy so hard?</h2>It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as "forbidden fruit" and a bit of a "challenge", he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with. "We're only human and there's an element of loneliness.<h2>Can a priest have a child?</h2>I've interviewed many priest children from around the globe — and some of their mothers, and some former priests who've also fathered children. One thing that's common across any country in any culture with children of priests is the secrecy.<h2>When did celibacy become mandatory for priests?</h2>Celibate for a millennium<p>The universal requirement to celibacy was imposed upon the clergy with force in 1123 and again in 1139.</p><h2>Does celibacy include kissing?</h2>Celibacy is the practice of not having sex. But not everyone defines celibacy the same way. Some people abstain from all kinds of sexual contact, including kissing or holding hands. Others only refrain from sexual intercourse.<h2>Are priests asexual?</h2>Priests were largely regarded as asexual beings, eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven, considered sexually, rather than merely metaphorically, neutered.<h2>Are nuns celibate?</h2>Celibacy for religious and monastics (monks and sisters/nuns) and for bishops is upheld by the Catholic Church and the traditions of both Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy.<h2>When did Catholic Church stop allowing priests to marry?</h2>The Norman ban on clerical marriage was reinforced in 1139, when the Second Lateran Council declared priestly marriage invalid throughout the entire Catholic Church. Of course, there were people, then as now, who broke the rule of celibacy -- some of them quite spectacularly. But the rule itself was clear.<h2>How much do priests get paid?</h2>The average salary for members of the clergy including priests is $57,230 per year . The top 10% earn more than $80,920 per year and the bottom 10% earn $30,450 or less per year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.<h2>Can priest have tattoos?</h2>Can a Catholic Priest Get a Tattoo? There's no rule or law that says that a Catholic priest is forbidden from getting a tattoo. However, it's very rare to ever see a Catholic priest that has a tattoo.<h2>Can priests smoke?</h2>Though there is no official canonical prohibition regarding the use of tobacco, the more traditional among the Eastern Orthodox Churches forbid their clergy or monastics to smoke, and the laity are strongly encouraged to give up this habit, if they are subject to it.<h2>Can priests drink beer?</h2>Do Priests Drink Alcohol? Alcohol is allowed for priests. An arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol was made shortly after midnight on Saturday for San Francisco Archbishop-elect Salvatore Cordileone, one of the authors of California Proposition 8.<h2>Is Cardinal McCarrick still a priest?</h2>— Former Roman Catholic Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the once-powerful American prelate who was expelled from the priesthood for sexual abuse, pleaded not guilty Friday to sexually assaulting a 16-year-old boy during a wedding reception in Massachusetts nearly 50 years ago.<h2>What happens if a priest breaks the seal of confession?</h2>Under Roman Catholic law, it is forbidden for a priest to disclose information — under any circumstances — obtained in the form of religious confession. If a priest breaks what's called "the sacred seal of confession," he will be subject to excommunication from the church.<h2>Which pope slept with his daughter?</h2>Alexander VI was notorious for fathering at least ten children and having many mistresses. He supposedly had a sexual relationship with his beautiful daughter, Lucrezia. On October 30, 1501, the Borgias threw a dinner party at the Apostolic Palace, the official residence of the pope in the Vatican.<h2>Can popes be female?</h2>But a woman is barred from becoming pope, because the person chosen for the position would have to be ordained — and women are barred from becoming priests. According to the Catholic Church catechism, Jesus Christ chose 12 men to be his apostles, and they in turn chose men to continue their ministry.<h2>Was there a 12 year old pope?</h2>Benedict IX was pope on 3 separate occasions during his lifetime, with the first being when he was just 12 years old. He grew to be a wicked boy and ran from the position to hide within the city when political opponents tried to murder him.<h2>How do nuns deal with periods?</h2>Nuns and girls also reported only taking half-body bath during period due to lack of hot water. All these call for a need to improve water and sanitation facilities in schools and nunneries so that nuns and schoolgirls do not compromise on menstrual hygiene and skip classes.<h2>Can a nun be pregnant?</h2>There have been previous instances in the Church of nuns becoming pregnant, but in some cases, this was not after consensual sex. In February this year, the women's magazine of the Church's newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, reported on several cases of sexual abuse on nuns by clergymen.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OoZKmqmZrAtb%2BMm6memZtisKa4yJuYnLE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./onyeka-ehie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Onyeka Ehie">&larr;
