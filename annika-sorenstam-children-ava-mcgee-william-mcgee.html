Annika’s global, on-course success and knowledge of the business helped her become the first and only female golfer to create a successful business brand, ‘The ANNIKA Brand.’</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Besides being one of the best golfers in history, Annika Sorenstam is a proud wife and a mom.

By seeing the snapshots, the look-alike both kids of Annika seem to be interested like their parents in the sports industry.</p><p>Both Ava and William are often spotted playing golf with their celebrity mom on the golf course. Besides, Annika Sorenstam’s son, Will, seems to be interested in Pickleball and soccer too. Moreover, he enjoys his music and drum classes as well.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Morning 9 holes with my little man Will <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@MontreuxGolf</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#juniorgolf</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VEhgkB7iP6</a></p><p>— Annika Sorenstam (@ANNIKA59) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">September 7, 2019</a></p><p><br>Furthermore, the talented and disciplined kids of Annika Sorenstam go on holiday with their family to various destinations.

Who knows? One day these junior versions of Annika and Mike might establish themselves in sports like their famous momma. Let’s hope so.</p><p>Moreover, Annika Sorenstam made her debut in the senior category and managed to win the prestigious US Senior Women’s Open. She defeated fellow Swedish golfer <strong>Liselotte Neumann </strong>in a thrilling competition and clinched her first senior trophy.</p><p>Sorenstam’s debut in the senior golf tournaments is undoubtedly a proud moment for the family. And her children might also be excited about their mom competing again.
