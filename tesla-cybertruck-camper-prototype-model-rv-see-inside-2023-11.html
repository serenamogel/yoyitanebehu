Wilkerson said he saw an opportunity to build something around the versatility of the Cybertruck.</p><p>"The cool thing about the Cybertruck is the fact that they will make one truck body shape and you won't have to juggle any submodels," Wilkerson said. "Once I started thinking about building it, I couldn't get the idea out of my head," he added.</p><p>Take a look inside the camper designed to seamlessly attach to the bed of the Cybertruck.

"We haven't promoted this too much because we're still sitting on standby a bit till we see more clarity on the truck. I think on November 30, a lot of things will be cleared up."</p><p>Wilkerson, a mechanical engineer who has worked at several startups, said the company has about five internal team members and has partnered with outside manufacturers on the project.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The camper, which is currently listed for $24,000, is designed so that it can be set up in moments with the switch of a button.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>When the attachment is closed it acts as a cover for the back of the truck.

While Wilkerson said Space Campers has a contact at Tesla, the EV maker has not officially shared any specs with the company.</p><p>"It's a little bit of this game of up and down with all the Cybertruck news," Wilkerson said. "We want to have all our ducks in a row, but we're waiting to turn the ramp up back on until Cybertruck is definite."</p><p>A spokesperson for Space Campers told Insider the company anticipates it will ramp up production in the second quarter of 2024.</p><p>Space Campers also faces some uncertainty with getting access to the Cybertruck once it's released. Over 1.5 million people have put down a $100 reservation fee for the Tesla truck as of last year, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>Electrek</a>. And even people who ordered the truck within an hour of Musk's first announcement of the EV have told Insider they have tens of thousands of people in front of them, at least according to an online queue estimator.</p><p>Wilkerson said the company is not one of the early reservation holders, but has befriended some people who have access.</p><p>For his part, Musk has said the ramp up in Cybertruck deliveries might be slow.</p><p>During<a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link> Tesla's earnings call</a> last month, the CEO said it will require a "staggering" amount of work to scale production of the vehicle due to its "newness." The billionaire said the company hopes to produce about a quarter million Cybertrucks per year — but likely not until 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufony1sdKlmGabqZeys8DRrpqkZZOWurGx0Wanq6ekpMG6vMRmpKiclaF6s8KMrJyeZZmjwKqwxGZpaWpjYn5y</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-study-gap-is-acceptable-in-germany.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How much study gap is acceptable in germany">&larr;
