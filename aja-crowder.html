She is involved in real estate as a realtor<strong> </strong>and works on television with the famous reality show <i>Baller Wives</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides her work, she is also the <strong>wife </strong>of retired American football player Channing Crowder. Many new generations of <strong>fans </strong>may not know much about him, which is expected since he wasn't in the NFL for long. Now let's learn a bit about Aja.</p><h2>Her Marriage To Channing Crowder</h2><p>Aja Crowder has found her love and is in a married relationship. <strong>Channing Crowder</strong> is the man that swept her off her feet, and they two look cute together. She tied the knot with the former NFL player on <strong>April 24, 2011</strong>.</p><p>It is unclear when and how these two crossed paths with each other. Even after all these years of marriage, their love only seems to grow strong. Both Aja and Channing are constantly posting about each other on their Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>In one such post on <strong>Valentine's </strong>day, Aja shared a picture of herself with her husband, and with the post, she wrote:</p><p>We ‘Here kitty kitty’n’ all Valentine’s Day We hope you all feel loved and spread love today&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/20/150190678_1703281929846563_6473896278201737228_n%20(1)-1671521301731.jpg><h2>How Rich Are The Crowders?</h2><p>You will see many married sports athletes worldwide who are the house's bread earners. However, this doesn't apply to the Crowders, as both husband and wife are the earners in the place. Following her husband's retirement, she generates a similar kind of revenue to him.</p><p>Aja Crowder surely knows how to earn, and her estimated net worth is the same as actor <a href=# rel=nofollow>Brice Bexter</a> at <strong>$5 Million</strong>. &nbsp;Working as a realtor is her most significant source of income. Her official website identifies her as a luxury realtor, and she works in South Florida.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, Channing Crowder has the same net worth as his wife at <strong>$5 Million</strong>. His net worth would have probably been much higher if it wasn't for his retirement, considering how much NFL players make. He currently hosts the Pivot podcast, his primary income source.&nbsp;</p><h2>Has Three Kids With Channing</h2><p>As of now, this romantic couple, Aja and Channing, are responsible for being the parents of three children. <strong>Channing Crowder III</strong>,<strong> Ava Milan Crowder</strong>, and <strong>Chaz Lee Crowder </strong>are their kids.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/20/261219726_260165706093629_5832932525277640219_n%20(1)-1671521490259.jpg><p>Channing III is the oldest of the three and was born the same year Aja married the former NFL linebacker. Then came their daughter Eva who was born in <strong>2013</strong>. &nbsp;And her youngest one, Chaz, was born in the same year <a href=# rel=nofollow>Austen Rydell</a> engaged to his longtime girlfriend, Billie Lourd, in <strong>2020</strong>.</p><p>You will find plenty of their kid's photos in Aja's Insta as she posts about them constantly. She is blessed to be a mother and loves her kids to death.</p><h2>Aja's Father-In-Law Is A Football Legend</h2><p>Aja Crowder's husband is not the only football player in the family. Her father-in-law, Channing's father, <strong>Randolph Channing Crowder Sr.</strong>, is a more prominent football legend than his son.</p><p>Like his son, Randolph&nbsp;also used to play for the Miami Dolphins. But he wasn't just a one-club man, as he also played for Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But much like his son, his career also didn't last long.</p><p>As Aja's husband says about him, he might be a brilliant player but not much of a good father. The following is what he had to say about his father:</p><p>The only thing I learned from him was about messing up, so I’ll try to be a better father than he was.</p><h2>She Used To Work In Marketing And Advertisement</h2><p>The real estate realtor Aja Crowder has made a name for herself today in the real estate world. She has been in this field for a very long time. However, real estate was not the first thing she worked on.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/20/246073387_185035073777931_2667176358767869727_n%20(1)-1671522005689.jpg><p>Before entering this world, Aja was in the field of marketing & advertisement, loosely related to real estate since you have to sell your product to people in both areas. Her official website says that she used to work in Miami and dealt with improving the brand presence of companies like Coca-cola, Universal Studios, and Live Nation.</p><h2>Studied At Howard University</h2><p>Aja works in the real estate world and entered here after working in advertising and marketing. Making a career in such a competitive space is hard, and she has succeeded in that, which begs the question, <i>what is her education?</i></p><p>It is unclear what she studied, but one thing we know about her is that she studied at <strong>Howard University</strong>. But looking at her career, her degree might be in marketing.</p><h2>About Her Husband Channing Crowder</h2><p>Randolph Channing Crowder is a former American football player known for his short spell in the NFL, where he played for Miami Dolphins. He was born on <strong>December 2, 1983</strong>, in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p><p>Randolph&nbsp;played as a linebacker, and with a weight of 250 lbs (113 kg), he was good at his craft. Unfortunately for him, people remember him more for all the trash talks he used to do than his footballing ability.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/20/317650951_155502057197965_8261732675915595059_n%20(1)-1671521715258.jpg><p>His NFL career may have been short, but his college football career was impressive when he played for Florida. Randolph&nbsp;was <strong>awarded </strong>the College football freshman of the year in <strong>2003</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Did Aja's Husband Channing Retired From Football?</h3><p>Channing's career as a football player didn't last long and may not have left the same mark on football as some other top players. However, his retirement news surprised many people as it came out of nowhere. One of the reasons behind his retirement was Aja's pregnancy. He wanted to be there for his wife, who was pregnant then.&nbsp;</p><p>Another reason was his time at Miami Dolphins. He spent his entire playing career at the club, and once they released him, he didn't want to play at other clubs. Some clubs had offered him a contract, but he didn't play.</p><p>Channing has talked about his time at New England Patriots, which has been mentioned in the news piece from <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Jacksonville.com</i></a>. He noted that it felt odd for him to train at a club that wasn't Miami Dolphins. He said:</p><p>It was just so weird. I went to their practice facility to work out, and I ran over the red dummies instead of the orange ones. I was so used to Miami, and I loved Miami so much.</p><h2>What Did The Crowders Said About Them That Shocked Kevin Hart?</h2><p>The lovely couple Aja and Channing's love for each other is no secret. Every couple loves to spend time together doing something they like. Crowders do something every year which shocked Kevin Hart. This was revealed by Channing while speaking at the Pivot podcast.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Aja and Channing spend time at the nudist colony. Every day they go there and walk around naked, and this shocks Kevin. People on the internet were talking about this, and people had a good laugh looking at Kevin's reaction upon hearing it.
