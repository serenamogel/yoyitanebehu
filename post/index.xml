Hot paprika, cayenne pepper, or crushed red pepper flakes can be substituted for the paprika. Ancho chile powder would be the most similar substitution, and it could even be blended with a pinch of salt.

The main character, Red (Jason Sudeikis), was a belligerent, often physically violent individual, sentenced by a judge to undergo anger management training, a plot line you'd expect to see in a live-action comedy aimed at grownups (like, well, "Anger Management"), and a lot of the social satire, while welcome, surely didn't register on most little ones.</description></item><item><title>Anna Hutchison Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</title><link>/anna-hutchison.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/anna-hutchison.html</guid><description>Her Social Media Profiles IG wiki FB Nickname Anna Gender Female Age 38 years old (in 2024) Date of Birth February 8, 1986 Real Name Anna Hutchison Profession Actress Nationality New Zealander Birthplace Auckland, New Zealand Zodiac Sign Aquarius Height, Weight &amp;amp; Physical Stats Body Measurements 36-26-34 inches Bodytype Hourglass Height 5 feet 5 inches (1.</description></item><item><title>Jack the Ankylosaurus, the Not-Good-Enough Disney Dinosaur | Far Flungers</title><link>/ffc-jack-the-ankylosaurus-the-not-good-enough-disney-dinosaur.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ffc-jack-the-ankylosaurus-the-not-good-enough-disney-dinosaur.html</guid><description>In this sequence of "The Good Dinosaur," one might be reminded of another scene where a father pushes a son to safety but dies.

Scar's henchmen the hyenas help start a stampede and Mufasa gets Simba to safety, but through Scar's treachery, ends up being trampled to death by the wildebeest.

It's one thing to spent $46 million; it's another to spend it insouciantly. The movie begins when the baron indignantly interrupts a play that is allegedly based on his life, and continues as he tells the "real" story of his travels - which took him not merely to Turkey but also to the moon, to the heart of a volcano, and into the stomach of a sea monster so big that people actually lived there quite comfortably, once they had been swallowed.</description></item><item><title>Best Cookies for a Cookie Swap if You Don't Bake</title><link>/best-cookies-for-a-cookie-swap-if-you-dont-bake.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/best-cookies-for-a-cookie-swap-if-you-dont-bake.html</guid><description>Cookie swaps kind of slap.
