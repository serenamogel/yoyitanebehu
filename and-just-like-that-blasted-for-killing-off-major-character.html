They ruined ‘Sex and the City’. F–k you HBO Max and [executive producer] Michael Patrick King!!! Not even going to watch this abomination of a show!!! Thanks for destroying Big and Carrie!’</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A third distraught fan simply posted</a>: “In shock. Please let it be a dream.”</p><p>However, the second episode of the series — which was also released on HBO Max Thursday — revolves around Carrie’s preparations for Big’s funeral, proving the death was no dream sequence.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Chris Noth has played Mr. Big since the first season of “Sex and the City” back in 1998. Big’s 23-year love story with Carrie came to an abrupt end during the premiere episode of “And Just Like That…” <span class=credit>GC Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Fans are in mourning after the “Sex and the City” spinoff “And Just Like That…” killed off a major character in its very first episode. <span class=credit>HBO Max</span></figure><p>And while at least Big and Carrie had one last hookup together before he went to his final, plush resting place in the skye, it was painful for many to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">witness the “weird” scene</a> in which Noth’s Big masturbated as Carrie slinked onto their bed to watch. (And did we really need the trendy “Bridgerton” reference?)</p><p>As the kids would say:&nbsp;Cringe.</p><p>The passing of Big was an especially shocking twist since actress Kim Cattrall <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">refused to reprise her role</a> as Samantha in the new series, which prompted many “SATC” lovers to theorize that her character <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would be killed off</a>.</p><p>Instead, “And Just Like That…” finds Samantha alive and well — if invisible to viewers and she’s living in London after a falling-out with Carrie and company.</p><p>On social media, many claimed the new series was suffering without Samantha’s sassy presence.</p><p>“Watching the new ‘Sex and the City’. Desperately missing Samantha,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one opined.</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Another concurred</a>: “Remember back when we watched ‘Sex and the City’ and wondered what the show would be like without stylish Samantha and her quick wit? Well, wonder no more. #AndJustLikeThat is super woke, but still bores viewers into a coma… Bring back Kim Cattrall.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Fans noted the absence of sassy Samantha (far right), who was one of the core four on the original “Sex And The City.” <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“Sex and the City” was never (or rarely) diverse, much less politically correct, so perhaps it was about time that the fab four — well, three now — got a little comeuppance. The world has evolved and gotten more inclusive since the second sequel film in 2010.</p><p>So “And Just Like That…” is notably more diverse than the original “Sex and the City,” with the arrival of a nonbinary character and several actors of color. But viewers who enjoyed the escapism and conspicuous consumption of the original “Sex and the City” found the new scenario forced. And just like that, cosmos and catty barbs, the audience was pummeled liberal buzzwords like “sex-shamed,” “patriarchy,” “gender binary,” “offensive,” “consent,” “cisgender,” “woke,” “white savior complex,” and on and on.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The show was also criticized by viewers for trying to be “woke.” <span class=credit>HBO Max</span></figure><p>“God this new sex and the city series is trying so hard to be woke and inclusive that it’s cringe,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one viewer complained.</a></p><p>“Reboot of ‘Sex and the City’ is pretty awful. I could not finish the first episode . I am not sure who this show is for but it will be a huge failure . It’s not funny or entertaining and has the worst elements of woke culture,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another stated.</a></p><p>Even if you hadn’t paid attention to social media spoilers, many elements of the premiere episode also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">were predictable</a> from the get-go. Fans learn that newly-woke-ish Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has quit her corporate law job to obtain a master’s degree in human rights and decides to pop into the iconic Smith’s bar and restaurant in Midtown at 10:45 a.m. before her first college class to down a glass of chablis. When told they didn’t open for 15 more minutes, Miranda decided it was cool to wait.</p><p>One’s first thought could have been, “Oh, she has time for a quick brunch?” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instead, it was</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for many</a>, basically: “So, Miranda is a functional (for now) alcoholic. Noted.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oh I know they better not be looking to make my girl Miranda an alcoholic!!! Unacceptable!</p>— Green Slime 1999 (@GreenSlime1999) <a href=#>December 9, 2021</a></figure><p>Also not entirely unexpected: When Big saddled up to his Peloton and started sweating bullets, you simply knew a heart attack was in his immediate future. But that also leads to a head-scratching question: Why didn’t Carrie immediately call 9-1-1 after she rushed to him while he suffered, sopping wet, on the bathroom floor? It’s like she actually wanted him dead so she could give her ex Aidan — played by “SATC” alum John Corbett, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who will reportedly return for the spinoff</a> — yet another shot.</p><p>Perhaps, again, viewers know where this is headed.</p><p>One bright spot: Maybe the spinoff, if successful, will mean more residuals for the show’s muse, author Candace Bushnell, who could now save face and strut away from her “insufferable” (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in the word of one critic</a>) one-woman, off-Broadway tell-all show, “Is There Still Sex in the City?”</p><p>Because, clearly, there are other issues to deal with.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGtmaXFflrulecmuqq1lnJ64pnnToZitZZKhrrTAxJ1kn6eiYriquMuipaBln5uzbrnAo6arZZOdrrOtwq2cq2c%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ella-thomas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ella Thomas  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">&larr;
