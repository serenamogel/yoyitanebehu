Vincent, like his father, is a footballer who plays for Manchester United Youth Club. His father, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, is recognized as one of the best attackers of his time, having played for clubs such as AC Milan, PSG, Barcelona, and Manchester United.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Vincent_Ibrahimovic_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Vincent Ibrahimović? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Vincent must have a net worth of <strong>$100,000</strong> from his time as a youth player at Manchester United. Although many clubs do not pay youth players, a well-established club such as United pays $4000 to $7000 every season. Despite earning a small salary per season, he maintains a luxurious lifestyle because of his rich father’s <strong>$190 million</strong> net worth.</p><p>When Vincent’s father Zlatan played for Manchester United, he was paid around $35 million. Similarly, his pay at the Los Angeles Galaxy was roughly $1.4 million. Along with that, he was the highest-paid football player in Major League Soccer, earning $7.2 million every season with the LA Galaxy, which equates to about $138,000 per week or $600,000 per month. According to Forbes, Zlatan was placed 30th among the world’s highest-earning athletes, ahead of footballers such as Samuel Umtiti, Thibaut Courtois, Dani Alves, and only behind Thiago Messi’s father, Lionel Messi.</p><p>Similarly, his compensation with Barcelona, AC Milan, and Inter Milan was between $10 and $18 million. According to Forbes, Zlatan supports popular companies such as Nike Mercurial and gets roughly $5 million from the arrangement. Similarly, he has his own business, A-Z, which is an innerwear brand from which he earns millions of dollars per year. He currently resides in Italy with his wife and owns properties in Malmo, Spain, England, and Sweden.</p><h2><span id=Vincent_Ibrahimovic-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Vincent Ibrahimović- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Vincent Ibrahimovic was born in Sweden on March 6, 2008, to well-known parents. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, his father, is a professional footballer, and Helena Seger, his mother, is a businessman and model. Vincent grew up alongside his older brother, Manchester United defender Maximilian Ibrahimovic.</p><p>He also has four aunts: Sanela Ibrahimovic, Monika Ibrahimovic, Karin Seger, and Violeta Ibrahimovic. Sapko Ibrahimovic, Aleksander Ibrahimovic, and Henrik Seger are Vincent’s three uncles. Vincent was also raised in Sweden by his grandparents, Sefik Ibrahimovic and Jurka Gravic.</p><p>Furthermore, 12-year-old Vincent grew up with a deep interest in football thanks to his father Zlatan, who inspired him to become a footballer. He began his career with the Paris SG young team before heading to Manchester United after his father joined them in 2016. He is currently with United and concentrating on his developing career as a defensive fullback.</p><h2><span id=Parents8217_Marital_Life>Parents’ Marital Life</span></h2><p>Vincent is still very young, so he is completely focused on his career goal of becoming a footballer like his father. As of today, the 12-year-old can be said to be in a romance with football.</p><p>Furthermore, his parents share a fantastic love story. Zlatan, Vincent’s father, first met his mother Seger in 2002. The pair met for the first time in a parking lot when his father noticed this strong and courageous woman who was ten years his senior. Despite their age difference, Zlatan was taken with her and asked her out. He was at the start of his career at the time, playing for a small club in his hometown of Malmo.</p><p>Nonetheless, after seeing Zlatan’s character and his prior life, she began to like him, and the current couple began dating in 2002. Despite being together for nearly 18 years, they have yet to marry or become engaged. Despite not being married, the perfect pair has two children from their relationship. They had their first kid, Maximian Ibrahimovic, in 2006, and the protagonist, Vincent, in 2008. As of today, the family is content, with no rumors or disagreements.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Mahbod Moghadam</a>, <a href=#>Kwhxte</a>, and <a href=#>Renata Jara</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Son</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>All You Need To Know About Carter Vrabel, Son Of Mike Vrabel</a></h3>Carter Vrabel is well-known as the son of Mike Vrabel, the head coach of the Tennessee Titans.
