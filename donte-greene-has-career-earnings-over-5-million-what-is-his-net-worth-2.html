After spending one season playing at the college level, NCAA basketball for the Syracuse Orange, the Memphis Grizzlies took a chance on him and picked him in the 2008 NBA draft.</p><p>Besides, he has an estimated net worth of $1.5 million. And undoubtedly, the bulk of Donte’s wealth came from his time spent playing basketball at the professional level in NBA and other minor leagues he participated in different countries,</p><p>On November 7, 2022, the former NBA star Greene was taken into custody in Goshen, Indiana, for robbery.</p><p>Goshen police moved quickly to apprehend a robbery suspect who was accused of attempting to commit a robbery at a gas station.

He made it throughout his NBA career, playing for different teams throughout five seasons. If the current inflation rate is considered, Greene’s total earnings will reach close to seven million dollars.</p><p>The 34-year-old American basketball player had a world at his feet when he first came to NBA in 2008 after the Memphis Grizzlies picked him in the 28th overall draft. But he was treated to the Houston Rockets soon after he arrived at the club.</p><p>The Rockets eventually parted ways with him and traded him to the Sacramento Kings in August 2008. Greene and the Kings agreed to a contract that would result in him earning $971,160 yearly.</p><p>The Sacramento Kings, who were pleased with his play and opted to raise his salary after the 2009–10 season, did so as part of a contract extension arrangement that included an increase in his annual compensation to $1,044,000.</p><p>And for the following two seasons, Greene saw a rise in his annual earnings. For the 2010-11 season, he made $1,116,840, and for the 2011-12 season, he earned the most in a year in his career as he racked up earnings of $2 million that season, making it the highest earning year of his career.</p><p>Greene inked a contract with the Atléticos de San Germán of Puerto Rico on March 11, 2013, to play with them during the 2013 BSN season. After playing just one game for Atléticos, he decided to part ways with the club on April 5, 2013.</p><p>He then agreed to a contract with the Memphis Grizzlies on April 17, 2013, worth $5,387, to play for the team for the rest of the season. In July 2013, he became the Grizzlies’ roster to participate in the 2013 NBA Summer League.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=donte-greene-career-earnings-by-hoopshype></span>Donte Greene Career Earnings By HoopsHype<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table style=border-collapse:collapse;width:61.611%;height:156.8px;border-width:1.3px border=1><tbody><tr style=height:22.4px><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center><strong>Season</strong></td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center><strong>Team</strong></td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center><strong>Annual Earnings</strong></td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>2008 – 09</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>Sacramento Kings</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>$971,160</td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>2009 – 10</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>Sacramento Kings</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>$1,044,000</td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>2010 – 11</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>Sacramento Kings</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>$1,116,840</td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>2011 – 12</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>Sacramento Kings</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>$2,015,896</td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>2012 – 23</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>Memphis Grizzlies</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>$5,387</td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center><strong>Total Earnings</strong></td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center>&nbsp;</td><td style=height:22.4px;border-width:1.3px;text-align:center><strong>$5,153,283</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=donte-greene-net-worth-is-1-5-million-dollar><span class=ez-toc-section id=donte-greene-had-a-net-worth-of-15-million-dollar></span> Donte Greene Had A Net Worth Of $1.5 Million Dollar<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Donte Greene had accumulated a net worth of $1.5 million, but he may have gone bankrupt.&nbsp;</p><p>The Former Grizzlies forward was detained for robbing a gas station. The only explanation for his action is that he in debt and gone bankrupt.</p><p>It has been said on several websites that his net worth is over a million dollars; however but that does not seem to be the case now. Why would a person with a million dollar worth try to rob a gas station?</p><p>A week ago, Donte Greene was all over the media for the wrong reason. Goshen police detained the 6-foot-11 former Sacramento Kings player on the robbery charge.</p><p>He was taken into custody by Goshen Police on a robbery-related offense early on Tuesday at a petrol station in Indiana. At 12:36 in the morning, police were called to the Phillips 66 in Goshen to investigate an allegation of a robbery.</p><p>He barged in and threatened the gas station attendant, who instead dialed 911. According to the reports, Greene was apprehended by law enforcement and said he was neither under the influence of alcohol nor possessing any firearms.</p><p>Should he be found guilty, he faces a potential jail sentence of between one and six years. However, what drove someone who was once an NBA superstar and made millions of dollars annually to get involved in the robbery is a mystery. Many believe he must have run out of money because of his lavish lifestyle.</p><p>He earned a little over five million in his brief NBA career, then he moved on to play in different leagues in different countries. But he was playing in other leagues rather than NBA meant less pay. The average salary of an NBA player in 2022 is about $4 million a year.&nbsp;</p><p>Donte even made earnings of $2 million one season in 2011-12 while playing for the Sacramento Kings. But other leagues do not have such an enormous financial value to offer players million dollars salaries. Thus after leaving NBA in 2013, Greene could not add a significant amount to his net worth.</p><p>However, even though he made far less than he used to earn while playing in the NBA, Greene’s luxurious life and extravagant spending did not change. He has always been a huge fan of fancy cars and fashion. He tweeted about wanting to buy a new Bugatti car in September 2013.</p><p>Dwelling in his past, the 34-year-old was born and raised in a middle-class German family. In the US-Soviet cold war era in 1988, his mother gave birth to him on the United States Air Force Base in Munich, Germany, while working as a national security agent.&nbsp;</p><p>The ex-NBA player grew up in a difficult childhood, and the financial condition of his family was severe. In 1990 his parents divorced, and then he was raised by his mother as a single mom. She had difficulty doing her job and taking proper care of Donte.</p><p>Greene’s mother passed away from a heart attack in October of 2001, and shortly after that, he relocated with his father and brother to Woodlawn in Baltimore County, Maryland,&nbsp;</p><h2 id=donte-greene-career-in-a-nutshell><span class=ez-toc-section id=donte-greene-career-in-a-nutshell></span> Donte Greene Career In A Nutshell<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Donte Greene had a stellar career after entering the NBA in 2008 after being selected by the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><p>The Grizzlies picked with the 28th overall choice in that year’s draft. Before that, Donte had a successful basketball career at the university level with the Syracuse Orange of the NCAA.</p><p>Greene was selected for inclusion in the U.S. Under-18 Men’s National Team. A year later, he was picked to play on the Nike Brand All-America Team and participated in the Jordan Classic. Similarly, he was honored with the state of Maryland’s Gatorade Player of the Year award.</p><p>The following year, Greene was nonetheless picked by Memphis at the 28th overall spot in the 2008 NBA Draft. After that, he went on to play with both the Houston Rockets and the Sacramento Kings.</p><p>Despite his promise, Greene still played professionally in Puerto Rico in 2013. He never reached his full potential. Since then, his professional basketball career has brought him across the world, with stops in Germany, China, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, the Dominican Republic, Taiwan, and, most recently, the Big 3 league.</p><p>Following his departure from the NBA, Greene went on to play professionally in different parts of the world. As a result, his popularity among NBA fans began to wane over time. In the 2017–18 season, he participated in his last professional basketball game with Champville SC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfo8GmecarnJ6mlWK1or%2BMnJirnZWneqat0aegp5%2BjYry3sdFmbGalmaG5qrvNZq6hmaRitrR5x6KqZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2ZqXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-anne-burrell-married-to-stuart-claxton-husband-and-family-life-372360-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Anne Burrell Married To Stuart Claxton?
