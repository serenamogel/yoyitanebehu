Her work in Florida as an attorney and as county prosecutor from 1978 to 1993 established Reno's stern and liberal reputation. In 1993, she was appointed U.S. Attorney General by President Bill Clinton, becoming the first woman to serve as U.S. Attorney General. She soon became one of the most respected members of the Clinton administration, serving until 2001.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Janet Reno was born in Miami, Florida on July 21, 1938. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Cornell University in 1960, she attended Harvard Law School. Reno graduated in 1963 and returned to her native Florida.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After several years in private practice, Reno ran for county prosecutor for Dade County in the late 1970s. She served in that position from 1978 to 1993, developing a reputation as tough, outspoken, unpretentious and liberal. Her cases varied greatly from political corruption to child abuse, which she skillfully handled. Reno was thrust into the national spotlight in 1993 when President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/bill-clinton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bill Clinton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bill Clinton</a> appointed her to become the first female U.S. attorney general.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">First Female Attorney General of the United States</h2><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Waco Siege</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the early days of her tenure as U.S. attorney general, Reno faced one of her biggest challenges. In early 1993, cult leader <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/david-koresh data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="David Koresh " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">David Koresh </a>and his followers, known as the Branch Davidians, ended up in a 51-day standoff with agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Reno was called upon to help resolve the situation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Reno approved the use of tear gas to flush the Branch Davidians from their compound outside of Waco, Texas. Unfortunately, it did not go as planned; a fire erupted and more than 70 Davidians (including Koresh and at least 20 children) died during the event. Reno publicly took responsibility for the outcome, saying on television: "I am accountable. The buck stops with me."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Accomplishments & Controversies</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite this controversy, Reno became one of the most respected members of the Clinton administration in its first term, known for launching innovative programs designed to steer non-violent drug offenders away from jail and espousing the rights of criminal defendants.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her readiness to nominate special prosecutors to investigate the president drew fire from the White House, but her political position was unassailable. Republicans attacked her handling of the campaign fund-raising scandal linked to the 1996 election, and there were some calls for her to step down. The anti-trust suit against Microsoft, Inc. in the late 1990s was the most publicized policy action of her tenure.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Oklahoma City Bombing; Unabomber Ted Kaczynski</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Reno was also in charge during the Justice Department's prosecution of several high-profile cases including the convictions of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman for his role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/timothy-mcveigh data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Timothy McVeigh" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Timothy McVeigh</a> and Terry Nichols for their deadly bombing of the Alfred P.

When confronted, they back down. When we remain silent, they flourish.”</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Elián Gonzalez</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the latter part of her second term, Reno faced another high-profile crisis when six-year-old Cuban immigrant <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/elian-gonzalez data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elián Gonzalez" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elián Gonzalez</a> was found floating on an inner tube off the coast of Fort Lauderdale in 1999. He was the only survivor of a group of Cuban migrants, including his mother, who died trying to gain entry to the United States. The young boy became the center of an international custody fight between his father in Cuba and his relatives in Florida. Reno became involved in negotiations and when they stalled in April 2000 she ordered a raid on the U.S. relatives’ Miami home that would ultimately return the young refugee back to his father in Cuba. Her controversial intervention enraged the Cuban American community in Miami. "We have been to great lengths to resolve this case in the least disruptive manner possible," Reno said at a news conference after the raid.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“To be vilified for returning a boy to his father is not a pleasant circumstance,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/obituaries/article113009183.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Reno would later say about the criticism she received for her decision" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Reno would later say about the criticism she received for her decision</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Years and Death By Parkinson's</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After leaving the post in 2001, Reno returned to Florida. She ran for governor in 2002, but failed to win the Democratic nomination. Since then, Reno largely stayed out of public life. She did, however, testify before the federal 9/11 commission in 2004 and voice her opposition to some of the nation’s anti-terrorism policies through a legal brief in 2006.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Janet Reno died at her home in Miami-Dade County, Florida on November 7, 2016, at the age of 78. The cause of her death was complications from Parkinson's disease, which she had battled since 1995.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Janet Reno</li><li>Birth Year: 1938</li><li>Birth date: July 21, 1938</li><li>Birth State: Florida</li><li>Birth City: Miami</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Janet Reno broke new ground in 1993 as the first woman to serve as U.S. Attorney General, serving under President Bill Clinton.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Law</li><li>U.S. Politics</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Cancer</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Cornell University</li><li>Harvard Law School</li></ul><li>Death Year: 2016</li><li>Death date: November 7, 2016</li><li>Death State: Florida</li><li>Death City: Miami</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=32><ul data-node-id=34 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Janet Reno Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/legal-figures/janet-reno</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: October 11, 2019</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGijnp%2BRoXqntcauqZ6rX5%2Bur7HTZqmepp8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lauren-london-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lauren London Height">&larr;
