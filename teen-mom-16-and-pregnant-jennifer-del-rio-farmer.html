I think the universe knew what it was doing."</p><p>As for the moms who stayed on, she shared: "I'm not a huge fan of the show.</p><p>"I catch glimpses here and there, and I used to keep up with Teen Mom OG."</p><p>She gushed over the original cast: "I love the OG girls and they're the sweetest girls ever."</p><p>However, the mom of four said she's happy she stepped out of the spotlight.</p><p>She said she will occasionally get recognized out in public, but always tries to brush off the attention.</p><p>Jennifer said: "Behind the scenes, <a href=#>Dr. Drew</a> talked about statistics at the reunion.</p><p>"They didn't show it on TV, but he kept saying, 'You know you're going to be pregnant in a year because of these statistics.'"</p><p>The ex-MTV star confidently stated retrospectively: "I'm not that girl - I was not going to be another number."</p><h2>BLAST FROM THE PAST</h2><p>After Jennifer's famous episode, she took her twins with her to <a href=#>Illinois</a> where she got her GED and went to college.</p><p>Later, she worked as a correctional officer at an all-men's prison in Florida before starting the farm.</p><p>Her relationship with her baby daddy from the show, Josh Smith, has grown through the years as much as she has.</p><p>Jennifer revealed she and her sons still stay in contact, despite him navigating his own troubled past.</p><p>The former 16 & Pregnant star said: "Everybody always says I'm well-known for my phrase I told him about never seeing his children again.</p><p>"I kind of knew that I was wrong - I just said it out of anger.</p><p>"He's had a rocky life ever since the show, although the twins talk to him every few months - maybe once or twice a year."</p><p>Jenn won the nasty custody battle against Josh back in 2012, and she reflected: "I wanted full custody because I wanted to know my children were safe with me, not because I wanted him out of the picture."</p><p>The <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> said she has warned her ex: "The door is always open to having a relationship [with the twins], but if you mess that up, that's on you."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Now, Jenn is married to Luis and they share a son, Sebastian, nine, and a daughter, Annabella, five.</p><p>Jenn shares her twin boys Joshua and Noah, 12, with her ex Josh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/i-reality-star-16-pregnant-806622730.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/i-reality-star-16-pregnant-806623412.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/like-wild-fire-teen-mom-753981678.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZ2qDdX6SaKuenZ5iurC5jGptZpmemXqxvsSgpZqmpGK3prrNop2eql2Zsq150aKmZp6Rp7qmvo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kendra-was-eight-months-pregnant-when-hank-baskett-betrayed-her-by-sleeping-with-ava-sabrina-london.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kendra Was Eight Months Pregnant When Hank Baskett Betrayed Her By Sleeping With Ava Sabrina London">&larr;
