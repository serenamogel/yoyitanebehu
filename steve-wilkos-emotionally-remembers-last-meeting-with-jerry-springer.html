And now, I think that night I saw him was his way of saying goodbye to me without saying goodbye. I wish I would have known. I think in his way he was telling me goodbye.</p><p>”He embraced me. He hugged me like he had never done before and he was telling me he loves me.</p><p>”We sat down, and I think back now, we were reflecting a lot on the good times that we had, which we normally didn’t do a lot, but this time it was a lot of reflection on the good times that we had together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/bfldsnvMSW8EshxC7iimOKARAQ4=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/4EASZRQE45EIBNL4YYGRQQ42JA.jpg"><p>”And I was telling my wife, for me, it makes a lot of sense today.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>”I’m hearing that he had pancreatic cancer, but he did not say anything to me. So, I’m really not sure. But if it’s true, then he definitely said goodbye to me in a way that he was letting me know that that was the end.”</p><p>Fellow talk show host Geraldo Rivera - whose show <i>Geraldo</i> aired from 1987 to 1998 - admitted he was also shocked to learn of Springer’s passing because he didn’t know he was ill either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/RbFL0wD8XXa9B19Y4Rh01ZG6RNY=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/WUMJJZ4Z4J32JW3HIEIEYP47PA.jpg"><p>He also spoke to <i>Entertainment Tonight</i> and said: “It was shocking to me. I mean, Jerry’s just a few months younger than I am. We kind of had our talk show run in the same era.</p><p>”He always seemed so full of light, so to get the news that he had passed was quite shocking.</p><p>”I can’t get in his head. I don’t know why he would keep it a secret. But it’s a very, very rough illness, so I can only surmise that Jerry didn’t want to be the topic of one of his own shows.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtbHVnmSwoZygvLR5xKamraGfo66tuNhmqZ6llaKvpr7SZqOaq6Riuqax06KloGWnnsGpecmeqauxXai9s7XNoJyrZ4ONl5uBlW6GjpJ0d5eGk6J%2FbntsdomTmKWkaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ryan-hollins-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ryan Hollins Net Worth">&larr;
