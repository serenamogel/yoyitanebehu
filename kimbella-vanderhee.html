Her business profits are not disclosed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/274302913_136580032192403_7072797802079608139_n%20(1)-1664101428794.jpg><p>Besides this, she also did magazine photoshoots and paid promotions through which she brought in a lot of money.</p><p>Kimbella's husband, <strong>Juelz Santana</strong>, has also tasted success in his rap career. Her husband's net worth is believed to be around <strong>$10 million</strong>. His music works with both movies and albums have garnered him a lot of fame and money and do nothing but improve the couple's financial status.</p><h2>Kimbella Controversy At Love & Hip Hop</h2><p>The relationship between Kimbella and Juelz hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows. The couple has seen its fair share of controversies.</p><p>The most significant controversy of their lovelife came from Kimbella cheating on Juelz. The controversy was revealed in <i>Love & Hip Hop: New York</i>. It is also considered one of the most scandalous moments in the show's history.</p><p>The controversy was about Kimbella sleeping with Fabolous. Fabolous was already in a long-term relationship with Emily Bustamente, who was also pregnant with his baby then. This led to all sorts of tension on the show, with Kimbella even getting in a physical altercation with Erica Mena.</p><h2>Married to Juelz Santana</h2><p>Kimbella Vanderhee has been married to <strong>Juelz Santana</strong> since <strong>2019</strong>. These two had one of Hollywood's most prolonged dating spells, as the pair dated for almost a decade before exchanging wedding vows.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/243353225_555112082378394_5602910764237584321_n%20(1)-1664101859932.jpg><p>Their fans were the happiest with the news. It's because their patience level had dried out thinking about whether the pair would marry.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Kimbella's Husband Served Jail Time?</h2><p>The rocky relationship and rough times for Kimbella and Juelz did not exist until their marriage. The rock-bottom moment in their relationship was probably when Kimbella's husband was sentenced to jail.</p><p>It didn't happen long after their marriage. Juelz was arrested at the airport when it was found that he was carrying a 38 caliber handgun and oxycodone pills with him. Upon being found guilty of weapon charges, he was sentenced to a <strong>27-month</strong> sentence.</p><p>He did not serve his full jail time. He was released after spending <strong>19 months</strong> in jail.</p><h2>Born To Biracial Parents</h2><p>Kimbella's body is made up of mixed genes. Her father, <strong>Ottelie Vanderhee</strong>, is an African American, while her mother, <strong>Sherry Vanderhee</strong>, is caucasian and white.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/270272780_1634410423560799_1899798007075869576_n%20(1)-1664101245867.jpg><p>Unfortunately, she grew up in a violent household with her abusive father. But, she has forgiven him as they worked on their deteriorating relationship. Her parents are still together and going strong in their relationship.</p><h2>Blessed With Two Siblings</h2><p>Kimbella went through a lot of trouble and pain with her family as a young child. Her pain was eased to an extent by her siblings at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>She has a brother named <strong>Kenneth Vanderhee</strong>. Kenneth has also appeared in one episode of her sister's show <i>Love and Hip Hop: New York. </i>She also has a sister who works as a professional DJ. Her stage name is <strong>DJ Lil Kim</strong>.</p><h2>About Kimbella's&nbsp;Husband: Juelz Santana</h2><p>Juelz Santana is a very successful American rapper. However, his actual name is <strong>LaRon Louis James</strong>. He is known for giving music to popular movies like <i>End of Watch</i> and <i>The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift, </i>the film that featured <a href=# rel=nofollow>Nathalie Kelley.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/306346551_632854414854946_4205926102190696334_n%20(1)-1664101615901.jpg><p>The New York-born rapper has also been nominated for the Grammy Awards on three separate occasions, in <strong>2003</strong>, <strong>2004</strong>, and <strong>2009</strong>. &nbsp;He is also a member of The Diplomats: hip hop group from the East Coast. The controversial rapper was born on <strong>February 18, 1983</strong>.</p><h2>Education Background</h2><p>There is this common misconception among the general population that the people who work in reality television come from embarrassing educational backgrounds. Kimbella has undoubtedly managed to break those stereotypical beliefs.</p><p>She has shut those people's mouths by graduating with a Masters's Degree. She holds a Degree in Pharmacy. All of this was before she entered the modeling world. Upon being asked about this, she said she always liked the idea of working in front of the camera and hence, switched her career.</p><h2>Has Been Open About Her Surgeries</h2><p>Many people have preconceived notions about how models and television personalities should look. It is a controversial subject matter where people are divided. Some believe they shouldn't be judged, while others say that's why they get paid.</p><p>Celebrities, for this reason, don't readily reveal if they have done some surgeries. However, Kimbella doesn't fall into this category. She has been very open about her surgeries because she feels there shouldn't be any shame in hiding them.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>In the past, she has talked about her Brazilian Butt Lift Procedure. She went through this surgery in the October of 2019. She has announced her surgery news while showing progress and final results through her Instagram.</p><p>She has also done surgery on her face. She has gone through some enhancements on her lips as well.</p><h2>The Dramatic Proposal</h2><p>Kimbella's husband, Juelz, made the marriage proposal. His proposal will go down in history books as one of the most dramatic wedding proposals of all time, just like <a href=# rel=nofollow>Terry Fator</a>.</p><p>The day was <strong>November 23, 2018</strong>. The venue was the Apollo Theatre in New York. Juelz went on stage with Kimbella, got down on his knee, and asked the question if she would marry him. Hundreds and Thousands of people were there, who got excited witnessing what was happening. She, of course, said yes.</p><h2>Mother To Four Children</h2><p>Kimbella is a mother of four children. She had two babies with her husband, Juelz Santana. The son carries the same name as his Father, <strong>Juelz Santana James</strong>. He was born on <strong>September 6, 2010</strong>.</p><p>Her other baby is a daughter <strong>Bella Monroe James</strong>. She is two years younger than her brother James.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/9/25/280104593_351404870196353_1577746072503214889_n%20(1)-1664102108264.jpg><p>They also have kids from their previous relationship.
