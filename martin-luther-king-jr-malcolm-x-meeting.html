His father, a supporter of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/marcus-garvey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marcus Garvey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marcus Garvey</a>, died when Malcolm was a child at the hands of what his family believed to be white nationalists. His mother was institutionalized several years later. Although highly intelligent, Malcolm dropped out of school and eventually drifted towards a life of crime. Arrested at the age of 21, he was introduced to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/religion/islam data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nation of Islam" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nation of Islam</a> while in prison. The group was also influenced by Garvey’s theories, and following his conversion and release from prison, Malcolm became one of the most prominent disciples of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/elijah-muhammad data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elijah Muhammad" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Elijah Muhammad</a>, the group’s leader.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Martin Luther King Jr. - Call to Activism" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/7c24aa61-3153-4c4f-9ebb-ef3e4fb61ab6/7c24aa61-3153-4c4f-9ebb-ef3e4fb61ab6_image.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King and Malcolm clashed over the best tactics to end racial discrimination and prejudice. Malcolm was highly critical of King’s nonviolent approach, believing King’s actions to be too slow-moving and too accommodating to white Americans and going so far as to refer to him as “a 20-century Uncle Tom.” Malcolm called for a more militant approach, achieving equality and Black liberation by “any means necessary.” King attacked what he considered Malcolm’s dangerous radicalism, writing, “Fiery, demagogic oratory in the Black ghettos, urging Negroes to arm themselves and prepare to engage in violence, as he has done, can reap nothing but grief.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Dive Deeper</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Earlier attempts at a meeting between the two went nowhere</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite their differences, Malcolm did make some effort to try to bring King and other <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/g46697536/civil-rights-leaders/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="civil rights leaders" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">civil rights leaders</a> together. In July 1963, Malcolm invited King to join a rally in Harlem. He called for a period of racial unity to fight white oppression, writing, “If capitalistic <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/john-f-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Kennedy class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kennedy</a> and communistic <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/nikita-khrushchev data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Khrushchev class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Khrushchev</a> can find something in common on which to form a United Front despite their tremendous ideological differences, it is a disgrace for Negro leaders not to be able to submerge our ‘minor’ differences in order to seek a common solution to a common problem posed by a Common Enemy.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King never responded to the invitation, and neither he nor other more moderate <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr-black-activists-civil-rights-movement data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="civil rights leaders" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">civil rights leaders</a> attended the meeting.

As cameras clicked away, Malcolm expressed his desire to become more active, saying, “I’m throwing myself into the heart of the civil rights struggle.” Then, just as quickly as it began, the brief meeting between the two legends was over. Four days later, opponents launched one of the longest filibusters in U.S. history to defeat the legislation, but it eventually passed. The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-act data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Civil Rights Act of 1964" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> was signed into law on July 2.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That April, Malcolm began an extensive visit to North Africa and the Middle East, which fundamentally shifted his thinking on the issue of race in America. While not entirely denouncing his earlier positions, he adopted a more conciliatory approach, writing, “I was no less angry than I had been, but at the same time the true brotherhood I had seen had influenced me to recognize that anger can blind human vision.” He went on to say, he believed “America is the first country… that can actually have a bloodless revolution.” Later that year, he founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity, a group that called for Black self-determination and economic independence and to connect African Americans with the African heritage.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A chance for another meeting was thwarted</h2><img alt="malcolm x speaks into microphones while standing behind a podium, he wears a suit jacket, collared shirt, and glasses" title="Malcolm X speaking in Harlem, New York City on February 15, 1965" width=2247 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/malcolm-x-speaks-at-the-audubon-ballroom-in-harlem-on-feb-news-photo-1708527254.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>On February 15, 1965, Malcolm X gives one of his final speeches in New York City before his assassination.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In February 1965, King and other civil rights leaders were in Selma, Alabama, leading a voting rights campaign. Malcolm traveled south to deliver a series of speeches. Although he continued to criticize King, he also met privately with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/coretta-scott-king data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Coretta Scott King" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Coretta Scott King</a>, stating his desire to work more closely with the nonviolent movement. He also noted that his attacks on King might have served a purpose, drawing the attention of white Americans towards his more radical beliefs and approach thereby making King and his moderate positions a more acceptable alternative. However, King and Malcolm X weren’t able to meet during his visit, as King and hundreds of others had been arrested days earlier while leading a protest march.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Just weeks later, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/crime/malcolm-x-assassination data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Malcolm was assassinated" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Malcolm was assassinated</a> by members of the Nation of Islam, while delivering a speech in New York’s Audubon Ballroom.

He became a vocal opponent of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vietnam War" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vietnam War</a> and the disproportionate effect it was having on African Americans, fighting for another country’s freedom while still confronting racism at home. He turned his attention to the systemic issue of poverty, branching out his focus from the segregated south to the entire country, including a Poor People’s Campaign that was to culminate in another march on Washington in the summer of 1968.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">King’s more fiery approach unsettled some of his more moderate supporters and gained him new enemies among civil rights opponents, but like Malcolm before him, it marked an evolution in King’s thinking. It was this campaign for economic justice that led King to Memphis, Tennessee, in April 1968, the scene of a strike by sanitation workers for better pay and equal opportunities.
